Pokemon Evolution Game
     The first file is how my code looked like when it was submitted, the second file is a revised version with comments added.
For this project, I was assigned to make a Pokemon Simulator game that would have a pokemon level up, train, and evolve. This is my best project for Comp Sci. I think the thing that stood out to me the most was the ascii art. I included 4 functions: Train, Gym Battle, Rest/Display Pokemon Info, and exit. One thing I struggled with on this project was changing the name, but after going through global variables, I ended up fixing that part of my code so that the name would change with each evolution. Another thing I did was I made 3 random training messages. So, if a player chose to train their pokemon, it wouldn't be the same "congrats! You leveled up!" and instead, 1 of 3 messages were randomly chosen to be displayed. I also included a cute ascii picture in the introduction message. Overall, I'm happy with my project because it's fun and it is well structured. 


Simple Calculator
     For this project, I was instructed to write code that would help a kindergartener with their math using simple math functions like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. I chose this project for my portfolio because even though the code and result is simple, I did enjoy the process of making it, and it also forced me to get comfortable with certain functions. For example, storing user input within a variable: When a user enters an answer into a prompt, I learned to store it into a variable to use it later on. Something else that was interesting for me about this project is that I played around with structure a little. I always disliekd when code would just be written line after line with no divison, so someone would probably be confused. I used 3 quotation marks instead of 1 and it made it so that I could place indents and line breaks in the actual result of my code. It looked much better that way.


Rock Paper Scissors
     For this project, I was instructed to write code that would let a user play the game Rock Paper Scissors, and would have their scores tracked against the computer until they decided to quit. A goal of this was to use a loop. Something I liked about this code was the random function. I used this function so that the computer randomly chose rock, paper, or scissors to play against the user. I also kept track of wins, losses, and ties. One thing I've been using more often are global variables, and I had to use that for a few things in my code. Something I struggled with was the names I used for my variables and functions. I realized how important it was to use very clear names for things, because it took me longer than I wanted to just due to the fact that I had confused myself. Beyond that, I learned how to change a user's function so it was lowercase.


MadLibs
     For this project, I was instructed to write code that would let a user input words to make a scenario. Something I struggled with for this program was I tried to write the code with 3 quotation marks so I could indent my lines. However, I wasn't able to do that, and so I left it as is. I enjoyed writing this because it was fun asking my friends for random words. I also used global variables for this project, which is something I've used a lot as of lately. The code was very simple, but I was spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to format the strings. It definitely served as practice for skills I'd forgotten.



Line Drawing
     This was a partner project I did with Diego. We worked to replicate a car with Idle. With this project, I used the penup function, as well as pensize. I thought this project was interesting because of how well it came out. Beyond that, I recall having a bit of difficulty when Diego and I combined our work. I had to adjust a lot of things. I had to tweak the pensize, the coordinates of where things were, etc. Though this project is very simple, I was very happy with the product. I also remember when Diego worked with circle functions, and when we combined our work, it was something I had to get familiar with as well to scale it with the rest of the car. I would have liked to add colors, but it still looks good regardless.
