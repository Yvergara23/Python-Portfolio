Pokemon Evolution Game
     The first file is how my code looked like when it was submitted, the second file is a revised version with comments added.

     For this project, I was assigned to make a Pokemon Simulator game that would have a pokemon level up, train, and evolve. This is my best project for Comp Sci. I think the thing that stood out to me the most was the ascii art. I included 4 functions: Train, Gym Battle, Rest/Display Pokemon Info, and exit. One thing I struggled with on this project was changing the name, but after going through global variables, I ended up fixing that part of my code so that the name would change with each evolution. Another thing I did was I made 3 random training messages. So, if a player chose to train their pokemon, it wouldn't be the same "congrats! You leveled up!" and instead, 1 of 3 messages were randomly chosen to be displayed. I also included a cute ascii picture in the introduction message. Overall, I'm happy with my project because it's fun and it is well structured. 


Simple Calculator
     For this project, I was instructed to write code that would help a kindergartener with their math using simple math functions like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. I chose this project for my portfolio because even though the code and result is simple, I did enjoy the process of making it, and it also forced me to get comfortable with certain functions. For example, storing user input within a variable: When a user enters an answer into a prompt, I learned to store it into a variable to use it later on. Something else that was interesting for me about this project is that I played around with structure a little. I always disliekd when code would just be written line after line with no divison, so someone would probably be confused. I used 3 quotation marks instead of 1 and it made it so that I could place indents and line breaks in the actual result of my code. It looked much better that way.
